They established their capital in Kanchipuram and ruled over parts of present-day Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The Pallavas were known for their contributions to art, architecture, and literature.
    <br><br>
    <h4>Mahendravarman I:</h4>
     Mahendravarman I was an important Pallava king who ascended to the throne around 590 CE. He is remembered for his patronage of art, literature, and architecture, and for his military campaigns that expanded the territory of the Pallava kingdom.
     <br><br>
     <h4>Rule from Kanchipuram:</h4>
     Kanchipuram, also known as Kanchi, was the capital city of the Pallava dynasty during Mahendravarman I's reign. The city was a center of political, cultural, and religious activity, boasting magnificent temples, palaces, and other architectural wonders.
     <br><br>
     <h4>Art and Architecture:</h4>
     Mahendravarman I was a great patron of art and architecture. He commissioned several notable structures, including rock-cut temples, monolithic rathas (chariots), and cave temples. These architectural marvels, such as the Shore Temple at Mamallapuram (also known as Mahabalipuram), are renowned for their intricate carvings and exquisite craftsmanship.
