             Tamil Nadu's strategic location on the east coast of India made it a vital center for trade and commerce during ancient times. Ports such as Kaveripattinam (modern-day Puhar) facilitated maritime trade with other regions, including Southeast Asia and the Roman Empire. The Pandya rulers played a key role in promoting trade and maintaining commercial ties with foreign powers.
